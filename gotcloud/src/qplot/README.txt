QPLOT
=====

The qplot program is to calculate various summary statistics some of which will be plotted in a pdf file which can be used to assess the sequencing quality for illumina sequencing after mapping reads to the reference genome. The main statistics are empirical Phred scores which was calculated based on the background mismatch rate. By background mismatch rate, it means the rate that sequenced bases are different from the reference genome, EXCLUDING dbSNP positions. Other statistics include GC biases, insert size distribution, depth distribution, genome coverage, empirical Q20 count and so on. An example plot and summary text will follow at the end.
